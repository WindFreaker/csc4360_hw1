Quick edit of the README to provide instructions on how to compile and run my application. I don't have access to my computer right now so I can't be 100% sure, but using the command 'flutter run' or 'flutter run lib/main.dart' should compile it into an application just like it did in my test environment. All the files I created (and then some) are located in this repository.
